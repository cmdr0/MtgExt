1 ) Because of image variations on basic lands, the search screen does not
accurately show inventory for these.
FIX ACTION: None yet

2 ) Add bin is non-existent
FIX ACTION: Adding bins will start as a console function and will eventually have
a dedicated button on the main page

3 ) Remove bin is non-existent
FIX ACTION: Same as add bin, but this will take longer, as I have to plan whether to have the bin
'move' all the cards to another location (such as 'Unbinned'), or remove them
from the inventory system entirely, though I'm leaning toward the latter.

4 ) No error checking on mass upload
FIX ACTION: None yet
